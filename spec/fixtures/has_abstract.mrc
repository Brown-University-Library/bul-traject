It is too often forgotten that he was also a self-proclaimed "world citizen" with a global vision, and that he envisioned the advance of globalization long before most of his contemporaries. This book exposes the global King who united in spirit and practice with other world leaders and representatives of the World Council of Churches to promulgate enduring peace and human community. It brings us to a new appreciation of the global King and explains how he continues to inform our understanding of what it means to live and function in the "world house." -- Provided by publisher.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 221-228) and index.10aKing, Martin Luther,cJr.,d1929-1968.  a.b73128417b08-18-14c08-18-14  ar0001b08-18-14cmdae-fenggoruh0i1  aybp  ePurchaseg1i31236098978615lrock o-p$0.00s-t0u0v0w0x0y.i177272211z08-18-14
